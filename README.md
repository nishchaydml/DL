Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. This helps improve the model's generalization and robustness. In the context of image data, the ImageDataGenerator class in the Keras library is commonly used to perform data augmentation.

Here , a data augmentation module using keras.preprocessing.ImageDataGenerator function is used for expanding the training data with more examples of same categories.
